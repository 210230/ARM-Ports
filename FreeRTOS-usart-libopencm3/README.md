Port of FreeRTOS to libopencm3
------------------------------

This project describes a port of FreeRTOS to work with libopencm3.

The example main program given here for the ET-STM32F103 blinks a LED and
responds to USART characters in separate processes. A similar example
program is provided for the STM32F4-discovery board.

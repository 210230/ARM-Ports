Ports of some Communications Libraries to libopencm3
----------------------------------------------------

This project describes ports of CANfestival, FreeRTOS and freeMODBUS libraries
to work with libopencm3. ChaN's FAT filesystem has also been adapted to
libopencm3 but this is not maintained here. Refer to the [Battery Management
System repository](https://github.com/ksarkies/Battery-Management-System/tree/master/chan-fat-stm32-loc3).

In addition there are a number of sample programs designed to run with the
ET-STM32-STAMP and ET-STM32F103 development boards, and the STM32F4-Discovery
board.

* CanFestival-test
* FreeRTOS-usart-libopencm3
* test-can-ETSTM32STAMP
* test-cli
* test-libopencm3-stm32f1
* test-libopencm3-stm32f4
* test-sd-card-spi
